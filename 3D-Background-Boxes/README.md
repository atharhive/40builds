# 3D Background Boxes

This project displays a grid of 3D boxes with a color-shifting effect. Clicking the "Toggle Effect" button will change the size and color of the boxes.

## New Features

*   The color palette has been updated to a more modern navy blue and teal scheme.
*   The boxes now get a random color from the new palette each time the effect is toggled.
*   The distracting GIF background has been removed.
*   The file structure has been reorganized into `css` and `js` subdirectories.
